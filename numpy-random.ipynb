    "The **numpy.random** function, part of the numpy software package, generates **pseudo** random numbers. An initial value, the **seed**, determines the output produced by the algorithm. For any given seed the  same 'random' output will be produced, hence the term 'pseudo'. Without knowing the seed an observer will not be able to predict the output. A truly random generator would always produce an unpredictable outcome - this could be, for example, by measuring the value of a physical entity, such as the level of background radiation. There are many applications however where a pseudo random output is adequate, or indeed desirable. Encryption and decryption of data is required for many purposes, a process that can use the output of a pseudo random generator. In order to decrypt data, the application receiving the encrypted data simply needs the same seed(s) value(s) that was used to generate the encryption key.  \n",
